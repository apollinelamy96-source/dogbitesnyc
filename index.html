<p>
In May 2025, New York State Senator Jennifer introduced Penny’s Law, a bill aimed at holding careless dog owners accountable. The legislation would expand legal definitions to include “cruelty to animals through negligent handling of a dog” and “leaving the scene of an animal attack.”
</p>

<p>
The bill is named after Penny, a 16-pound Chihuahua who was attacked by two pit bulls on the Upper West Side. The incident sparked debate around dog safety and owner responsibility in New York City.

<p>
Dog bites pose serious risks not only to animals, but also to people.

Injuries
</a>
can range from damage to skin and muscles to more severe harm involving nerves or bones.
Dog bites can also lead to infections, as dogs’ mouths carry bacteria.
In some cases, bites can transmit diseases such as tetanus, particularly if a person’s vaccinations are not up to date.
</p>

<p>
According to Sylwia Kolowiecka, a dog behaviorist based in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, dogs often react aggressively in specific situations.
</p>

<blockquote>
  “Biting behavior often happens because of rapid movement, like jogging, or when someone approaches a dog in an inappropriate way,” Kolowiecka said.
  “People should never lean over a dog or invade its space.”
</blockquote>

<p>
Data from <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-Dog-Bite-Data/rsgh-akpg/about_data" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene
</a> shows that ZIP code 10029, which corresponds to East Harlem,a neighorhood next to Central Park, has recorded the highest number of dog bites in New York City, with 521 incidents reported since 2018.
</p>


<p>
Neighborhoods surrounding Central Park also show elevated numbers of dog bite reportsThis could be due to the park’s off-leash hours, which run from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m., allowing dogs to roam freely. While these hours are popular with dog owners, they may increase the risk of encounters between dogs and pedestrians.
